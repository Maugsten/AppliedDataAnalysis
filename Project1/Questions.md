# Questions

## Beta variance

Are we supposed to plot the beta-variance for the real data?

What do we do when we don't have any information about the noise? 

What happens when there is no noise, which means that the variance of the noise (sigma^2) is zero? 

# TODO

Create a plot-function.

Implement some code lines in the report.

Check that Ridge with lambda = 0 gives the same result as OLS.
